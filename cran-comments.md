## Submission for elo 3.0.0

I was not made aware that this package was going to be removed from CRAN. This is a resubmission to reinstate the package.
This version includes several breaking changes, and many bug fixes, including the offending one for R-devel.

## Test environments

* R 3.6.2, 4.0.3, 4.1.2 (local Linux install)

* win-builder (devel, release, and old release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

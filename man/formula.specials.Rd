\description{
Details on \code{elo} functions and the special functions allowed in them to change functions' behaviors.
Note that these functions aren't defined in the namespace (exported or otherwise); rather, they live inside the
functions which use them (i.e., see \code{\link{elo.model.frame}}).
}
\details{
In the functions in this package, \code{formula} is usually of the form \code{wins.A ~ elo.A + elo.B},
  where \code{elo.A} and \code{elo.B} are vectors of Elos, and \code{wins.A} is between 0 and 1,
  denoting whether team A (Elo A) won or lost (or something between). \code{elo.prob} also allows
  \code{elo.A} and \code{elo.B} to be character or factors, denoting which team(s) played. \code{elo.run}
  requires \code{elo.A} to be a vector of teams or a players matrix from \code{players()}
  (sometimes denoted by \code{"team.A"}), but \code{elo.B} can be either a vector of teams or
  players matrix (\code{"team.B"}) or else a numeric column (denoting a fixed-Elo opponent).

\code{formula} accepts five special functions in it:

\code{k()} allows for complicated Elo updates. For
  constant Elo updates, use the \code{k = } argument instead of this special function.

\code{adjust()} allows for Elos to be adjusted for, e.g., home-field advantage. The second argument
  to this function can be a scalar or vector of appropriate length.

\code{regress()} can be used to regress Elos back to a fixed value
  after certain matches. Giving a logical vector identifies these matches after which to
  regress back to the mean. Giving any other kind of vector regresses after the appropriate
  groupings (see, e.g., \code{\link{duplicated}(..., fromLast = TRUE)}). The other three arguments determine
  what Elo to regress to (\code{to = }), by how much to regress toward that value
  (\code{by = }), and whether to continue regressing teams which have stopped playing (\code{regress.unused},
  default = \code{TRUE}).

\code{group()} is used to group matches (by, e.g., week). It is fed to \code{\link{as.matrix.elo.run}}
  to produce only certain rows of matrix output.

\code{players()} is used for multiple players on a team contributing to an overall Elo. The Elo updates
  are then assigned based on the specified weights.

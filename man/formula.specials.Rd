Details on \code{elo} functions and the special functions allowed in them to change functions' behaviors.

\details{
In the functions in this package, \code{formula} is usually of the form \code{wins.A ~ elo.A + elo.B},
  where \code{elo.A} and \code{elo.B} are vectors of Elos, and \code{wins.A} is between 0 and 1,
  denoting whether team A (Elo A) won or lost (or something between). \code{elo.prob} also allows
  \code{elo.A} and \code{elo.B} to be character or factors, denoting which team(s) played. \code{elo.run}
  requires \code{elo.A} to be a vector of teams or a players matrix from \code{players()}
  (sometimes denoted by \code{"team.A"}), but \code{elo.B} can be either a vector of teams or
  players matrix (\code{"team.B"}) or else a numeric column (denoting a fixed-Elo opponent).
  \code{elo.glm} requires both to be a vector of teams or players matrix. \code{\link{elo.markovchain}}
  requires both to be a vector of teams.

\code{formula} accepts six special functions in it:

\code{k()} allows for complicated Elo updates. For
  constant Elo updates, use the \code{k = } argument instead of this special function.
  Note that \code{\link{elo.markovchain}} uses this function (or argument) as a convenient
  way of specifying transition probabilities. \code{\link{elo.colley}} uses this to indicate
  the fraction of a win to be assigned to the winning team.

\code{adjust()} allows for Elos to be adjusted for, e.g., home-field advantage. The second argument
  to this function can be a scalar or vector of appropriate length. This can also be used in
  \code{\link{elo.glm}} and \code{\link{elo.markovchain}} as an adjuster to the logistic regressions.

\code{regress()} can be used to regress Elos back to a fixed value
  after certain matches. Giving a logical vector identifies these matches after which to
  regress back to the mean. Giving any other kind of vector regresses after the appropriate
  groupings (see, e.g., \code{\link{duplicated}(..., fromLast = TRUE)}). The other three arguments determine
  what Elo to regress to (\code{to = }), by how much to regress toward that value
  (\code{by = }), and whether to continue regressing teams which have stopped playing (\code{regress.unused},
  default = \code{TRUE}).

\code{group()} is used to group matches (by, e.g., week). For \code{\link{elo.run}}, Elos are not updated until
  the group changes. It is also fed to \code{\link{as.matrix.elo.run}}, giving the number of rows to return.
  to produce only certain rows of matrix output. It also determines how many models to run (and on what data)
  for \code{\link{elo.glm}} and \code{\link{elo.markovchain}} when \code{running=TRUE}.

\code{neutral()} is used in \code{\link{elo.glm}} and \code{\link{elo.markovchain}} to determine the intercept.
  In short, the intercept is \code{1 - neutral()}, denoting home-field advantage. Therefore, the column
  passed should be 0 (denoting home-field advantange) or 1 (denoting a neutral game). If omitted, all matches
  are assumed to have home field advantage.

\code{players()} is used for multiple players on a team contributing to an overall Elo. The Elo updates
  are then assigned based on the specified weights. The weights are ignored in \code{\link{elo.glm}}.

\code{multiteam()} is used for matchups consisting of multiple teams and is only valid in \code{\link{elo.run.multiteam}}.
